# PhysDrive Dataset

## 📖 Abstract

**Here is [NIPS2025] PhysDrive: A Multimodal Remote Physiological Measurement Dataset for In-vehicle Driver Monitoring, collected by The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou).**  
The PhysDrive, comprises about 24 hours(**1500K frames**) of recordings from RGB camera, NIR camera, and an mmWave radar of 48 subjects. The dataset was designed to ontactless in-vehicle physiological sensing with dedicated consideration on various modality settings and driving factors, including **Three vehicle types, four illumination conditions, three road conditions, and driver motions**. PhysDrive is comprehensive with six synchronized ground truths (**ECG, BVP, Respiration, HR, RR, and SpO2**) and can be used in conjunction with the [rPPG-toolbox](https://github.com/ubicomplab/rPPG-Toolbox).  

## 🔥 Updates
**[2025/5]** **Code for benchmark and preprocessing is updated.**  
 For those who have downloaded or are preparing to download our dataset: you are recommended to star this repo in case the dataset is updated without notice.



## 🗝️ Access and Usage
**This dataset is built for academic use. Any commercial usage is banned.**  
There are two kinds of datasets for your convenience: 
Preprocessed (one-subject raw RGB and NIR data and all-subject preprocessed mmWave data ([link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/xiaoyang274/physdrive), no need for data share agreement); Raw (all-subject raw data, requires signing data share agreement, please contact Xiao Yang xyang856@connect.hkust-gz.edu.cn).
